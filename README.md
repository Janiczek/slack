# slack
A meta repo for all things Slack-related


## Admins

## General

- Avoid threads in main discussions channels This isn't a hard rule, and threads can be super helpful, but it's better to default to keeping chat in the channel when possible. It helps everyone see the conversations.
- If the discussion is about a particular library or problem, a slack channel dedicated may be worthwhile, if the conversations are long.

## Channels

On the Elmlang Slack, we try to keep discussions in the right place. Deciding where the right place for something is often quite difficult, but these are some rules I try to follow:

- **#general** is a channel that _everyone_ has to be part of. In order to be wary of that, it's important to keep things focused on Elm there. Other discussions about things unrelated to Elm directly should go to #random.
- If you need help, go to **#admin-help**. We can help you out with any problems. Otherwise, you can PM an admin.
- **#news-and-links** should be for sharing links only -- take discussions to other channels, or use threads 
- Keep posts on jobs in **#jobs**, and make sure your description states location, remote-friendly, language, and a link to your site. Keep things in tl;dr format.
- Long help threads should go to #help. 
- **#beginners** is intended for learning questions - questions about native/kernal code or more complex aspects of Elm should go to **#help** or **#general**.
- **#elm-dev** is intended for discussion on how to implement complex things with Elm, or the internals of how Elm works. For example, lots of questions were asked there during the implementation of Ellie. 
- **#package-design** is intended for helping people to write better packages


## Misc
- We have archivable history! Invite `archivebot` to the channel and it will be archived past the limit of Slack.
